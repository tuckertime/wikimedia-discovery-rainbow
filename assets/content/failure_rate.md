Search Queries with Zero Results
=======

Sometimes, searches return zero results. What we're visualising here is the number of times that happens, contrasted with the number of queries overall.

Zero results doesn't actually mean a failure for the user, of course: some of these events are from "prefix search" in the search box, where the system attempts to match the user's already-typed characters to an existing page name. Others are from typos, resulting in a search page with no results, but *also* resulting in a spelling correction the user could use to get genuine results.

We've also broken out the daily rate of change - the failure proportion's increase or decrease per day. We expect the failure rate to monotonically decrease over time once we start with projects and patches aimed at decreasing this rate.

* On 15 July 2015 we updated our heuristics to avoid counting maintenance tasks as search requests. The historic data on the dashboards is being backfilled to reflect this - until it's done, the dashboards may look somewhat strange.
