Key Performance Indicator: Zero results rate
=======

If a user gets zero results for their query, they’ve by definition not found what they’re looking for.

Outages and inaccuracies
------
* On 15 January 2016 there was an [issue](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T123541) with Avro serialization that prevented data from entering the Hadoop cluster. A [patch](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/264989/) was deployed on 19 January 2016. As a result, there are no recorded zero results rates for 01/15-01/18. The values you may see on those dates are estimates computed with statistical models.
